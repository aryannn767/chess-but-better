### Chess Multiplayer Game - Backend (TypeScript) & Frontend (Vite React) with WebSocket Integration

----------

#### Overview

This markdown provides a detailed description of a chess multiplayer game that leverages TypeScript for the backend, a Vite React frontend, and WebSocket for real-time player interactions. The game implements all chess-related functionalities, including move validation, possible moves detection, check detection, and checkmate detection, without relying on external chess libraries.

----------

### Backend (TypeScript)

The backend of the chess game is developed in TypeScript and manages the core game logic and WebSocket communication.

#### Key Features:

1.  **Game Initialization**:
    
    -   Set up a chess board represented as an 8x8 matrix.
    -   Initialize player data, turn management, and game state.
2.  **Move Validation**:
    
    -   Validate player moves according to standard chess rules.
    -   Check if a move is legal, including:
        -   Ensuring a piece belongs to the player making the move.
        -   Validating moves according to piece-specific movement rules (e.g., pawns, knights, bishops, etc.).
        -   Enforcing movement restrictions (e.g., no moves beyond board boundaries).
3.  **Possible Moves Detection**:
    
    -   Detect all valid moves for a given piece on the board.
    -   Ensure possible moves adhere to chess rules (e.g., diagonal for bishops, straight for rooks, etc.).
4.  **Check Detection**:
    
    -   Identify if a king is under threat from opponent pieces.
    -   Return information regarding threats and possible ways to escape or block check.
5.  **Checkmate Detection**:
    
    -   Determine when a game ends in checkmate.
    -   Ensure game over condition, no valid moves remaining for the player in checkmate.
6.  **WebSocket Integration**:
    
    -   Handle real-time communication between players.
    -   Transmit board updates, moves, and game state to both players instantly using WebSocket.

----------

### Frontend (Vite React)

The frontend, developed with Vite and React, interacts with the backend using WebSocket, rendering the game dynamically.

#### Key Features:

1.  **Chess Board Display**:
    
    -   Render an 8x8 chess board with clickable squares for piece movement.
    -   Highlight valid moves for selected pieces and visually indicate check or checkmate states.
2.  **User Interface**:
    
    -   Allow players to make moves via drag-and-drop or click actions.
    -   Display game state, current playerâ€™s turn, and real-time updates from the backend.
3.  **WebSocket Communication**:
    
    -   Establish and maintain a WebSocket connection to receive and send board state updates.
    -   React to real-time changes such as board updates, piece movements, and game state alterations.
4.  **Move Handling**:
    
    -   Handle user inputs, validate them, and send them to the backend for processing.
    -   Display feedback on successful or invalid moves.

----------

### Flow

1.  **Player Connection**:
    
    -   Players connect to the game via WebSocket.
2.  **Game Initialization**:
    
    -   The board is initialized on both sides, and players are assigned their roles (white or black).
3.  **Gameplay**:
    
    -   Players take turns moving pieces. The backend validates each move, ensuring that only valid moves are accepted.
    -   Possible moves are displayed on the frontend, allowing players to choose a valid move.
4.  **Detection**:
    
    -   Check and checkmate are detected by the backend and communicated to the frontend.
5.  **End Game**:
    
    -   When a checkmate is detected, the game ends, and the winner is displayed on both sides.

----------

This system ensures a seamless multiplayer chess experience where both players receive instant feedback and updates through WebSocket communication, with all game logic handled internally using custom validators.
